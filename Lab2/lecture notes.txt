(1)1 change in a object affects entire objects in script
(2) Node module that exposes user's module so it can be used
(3)This works because your code is actually wrapped in a function that is given these things as function parameters
(4) C++ core for System event, adn javascript core for custom event
(5)organize code into reusable code, communitcate over internet, accept requests and send response
